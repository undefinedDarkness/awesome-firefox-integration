Installation
------------

git clone https://github.com/undefinedDarkness/awesome-firefox-integration.git
cd awesome-firefox-integration
make
# In firefox:
# Navigate to about:addons
# Under the cog menu, select `Install From File'
# In the file selector:
#   Navigate to the */awesome-firefox-integration folder

# Add integration to awesome / whatever linux apps you want

Interface [[SUBJECT TO CHANGE]]
---------
Currently, The Python script creates 2 files,
/tmp/ff-tabs-input & /tmp/ff-tabs-output

It will read commands from `ff-tabs-input',
*after* getting a USR1 signal from the system ($ kill -s USR1 $(pgrep server.py))

It writes its output or any data it recieves from the firefox extension to `ff-tabs-output`,
...

Structure

/--------------------------------------------\      /------------\    /---------\
| Firefox | Extension => Python Native Host  | ==>  | Linux IPC* | => | Awesome |
\--------------------------------------------/      \------------/    \---------/

* Currently by IPC, I mean we have a couple of files that are used to read output and send commands to the native host
  I plan to move this to named pipes

TODO
----
- Remove script dependency on awesome-client
- Move to named pipes
- Support for multiple instances of firefox
- Support for different editions (nightly, dev)
